# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions (Golang)

This repository houses my Golang implementations for the Advent of Code 2023 puzzles. Each solution resides in a dedicated folder named `day_x`, corresponding to the day number.

## Prerequisites

Before embarking on this code-solving journey, ensure you have Golang installed on your system. Head to the official website to download and install Golang: [https://go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install): [https://go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install)

## Usage

To execute a solution for a specific day, follow this command structure:

```
go run day_x/main.go
```

Replace `x` with the corresponding day number to run the desired solution. The solution will output the puzzle's answer to the console.

## Contributing

If you're eager to contribute your solutions to this repository, adhere to these guidelines:

- Each solution should reside in an individual folder named `day_x`, corresponding to the day number.
- Maintain clear and comprehensive documentation for your solution, enhancing its understandability.
- Strive for efficient solutions that employ idiomatic Golang coding practices.
